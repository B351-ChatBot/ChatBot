i have started the more detailed pseudocode in Transformed NN, 

i have swapped from images to a more relevant neural net, which takes text as input, 
and outputs that it is either a pos or neg statement

we will be formatting our data to match its input. essentailly modifying create_sentiment_featuresets.py

we will create a dictionary of equivalent outputs. (low priority)

i will be changing the output from pos or neg. to be a node for one of every possible equivalent output. 
(i will focus on this)


we have to modify this so, instead of just outputting an accuracy test. the user can interact with it
